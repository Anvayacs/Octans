- Currently Programmed to formulas of India Grade-10
- Considerate expansion of the software to also make it a research based program with tools like wikipedia, dictionary, text analysis etc..
- The Program is incomplete as of 12-1-2021 [Changes are to be committed]

## Imports Made in this Program:
- math module
